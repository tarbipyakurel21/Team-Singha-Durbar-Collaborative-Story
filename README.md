# The Collaborative Story


It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pattered against the window, but a lone cursor blinked on a screen, ready to write the next chapter. Suddenly, a portal opened with sparks of golden light. From it stepped Doctor Strange, standing before the mighty Dormamu. Doctor Strange said, 'Dormamu, I have come to bargain.' The blinking cursor echoed, 'Loop it again... until we merge.' Dormamu’s laughter shook the digital void. Yet the loop continued, branch after branch, commit after commit. Dormamu roared, 'Your pull requests are endless!' Doctor Strange replied, 'That’s the point… until you approve the merge.'
