# The Collaborative Story


It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pattered against the window, but a lone cursor blinked on a screen, ready to write the next chapter. Suddenly, a portal opened with sparks of golden light. From it stepped Doctor Strange, standing before the mighty Dormamu. Doctor Strange said, 'Dormamu, I have come to bargain.' The blinking cursor echoed, 'Loop it again... until we merge.' Dormamu’s laughter shook the digital void. Yet the loop continued, branch after branch, commit after commit. Dormamu roared, 'Your pull requests are endless!' Doctor Strange replied, 'That’s the point… until you approve the merge.' The void rippled like broken code. Each bargain created a new branch, splitting into infinite timelines of rejected merges. Dormamu’s face glowed like corrupted syntax, sneering at Strange’s persistence. 'You waste eternity,' Dormamu thundered, his voice echoing like a failing build pipeline. 'No reviewer will ever approve this!' Doctor Strange adjusted his cloak, now embroidered with glowing GitHub octocats.
